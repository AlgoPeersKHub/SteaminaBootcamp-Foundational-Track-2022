# Foundational-Track
This repository contains code developed by learners aged 7â€“15 as part of hands-on explorations into emerging technologies such as AI, machine learning, physical computing, and coding. Learners used the BBC micro:bit, programmed with Microsoft MakeCode, and locally available materials to build prototypes addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including climate action, clean energy, and quality education.
The projects promote learning through making and collaboration in meaningful contexts. Instruction was guided by Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (Ladson-Billings, 1995) and Universal Design for Learning (CAST, 2018), ensuring inclusive, identity-affirming experiences. 
Learners expressed ideas through code, storytelling, sketches, and physical builds, reflecting our commitment to equitable, high-impact STEAM education in low-resource settings.


**You'll delve into the micro:bit and how to code through interesting projects.**
