## Introduction

Ever wondered how you could visualize the temperature using your micro:bit? 

This project allows you to do just that! You'll explore the temperature sensor, buttons, and LEDs using the micro:bit.



## Parts of the Micro:bit

1. **Temperature Sensor:** Measures and provides temperature data.
2. **LEDs (Light Emitting Diode):** Displays temperature-related information.
3. **Buttons:** Input for interaction with the micro:bit.


## Programming Concepts

 **Function:** A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. In this project, functions will be employed to enhance code organization and readability.


## Programming Language

  Python


## Coding Environment / Text Editor

  [Microsoft MakeCode Editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor)
